A simple Wordpress plugin for adding geographic data to posts.

== Description ==

####Features

1. Adds `location`, `latitude`, and `longitude` meta + metaboxes to any content type.
2. Provides an easy to use interface for selecting which content types to apply the above meta values. *Note: this allows selection of built in types: page and post as well as any registered custom post types.*
3. Provides `WP_GeoQuery` an extended `WP_Query` class for doing distance based and geo-aware queries.

#####Coming Soon!

* Add support for `within radius` option to WP_GeoQuery
* HTML5 geolocation of visitors, with a fallback to `Change Location` (stored as COOKIE)
* Custom Markers by post type.
* Shortags for:
 * `Get Directions` link (utilizing Google Maps)
 * Static Map - show one or more posts on a static map
 * Dynamic Map - show one or more posts on a dynamic map
 * Option to show radius as overlay (for `within radius` calls)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the post meta keys that your metabox adds? =

For every post type selected on the plugin settings page. That type's add/edit screens will have an additional metabox automatically added. Metadata that is added to each record:

 - **Location** via `wp_gp_location`
 - **Latitude** via `wp_gp_latitude`
 - **Longitude** via `wp_gp_longitude`

= How do I use WP_GeoQuery? (What is it for?) =

Make a geo-aware query against the posts table. `WP_GeoQuery` accepts all arguments that `WP_Query` takes. `latitude` and `longitude` are optional parameters. If passed, `distance` is calculated and returned with each result. In addition to the regular fields, each result returns `latitude`, `longitude`, and `location`.

```php
<?php
$query = new WP_GeoQuery(array(
  'latitude' => '37.5160', // User's Latitude (optional)
  'longitude' => '-77.5005', // User's Longitude (optional)
  'posts_per_page' => 25, // Any regular options available via WP_Query
));
foreach($query->posts as $post)
{
	echo " {$post->post_title}<br />\n";

	// returned only if latitude and longitude are passed into WP_GeoQuery
	echo " {$post->distance}<br />\n";

	// Always returned by WP_GeoQuery
	echo " {$post->location}<br />\n";
	echo " {$post->latitude}<br />\n";
	echo " {$post->longitude}<br />\n";
	echo "<br />\n";
}
?>
