Facetious lets you add a faceted - often called an 'advanced' - search form to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Facetious lets you add a faceted - often called an 'advanced' - search form to your WordPress website. It comes with a ready-to-use sidebar widget, plus a number of implementation options for developers.

A Facetious form can include dropdown lists of:

 * Taxonomy terms (tags, categories, and custom taxonomies)
 * Months
 * Plus a conventional search input box

You can also restrict searches by post type _(singular)_, if you so desire.

Additionally, Facetious introduces an extra 'pretty permalink' structure around search queries, which may help your site performance if you're using a caching plugin like WP Super Cache. Also, they look a heck of a lot friendlier than `?s=polly&post_type=pet&category=bird`. (You don't even have to display a faceted search form on your site to benefit from these, by the way).

Please note - Facetious isn't a replacement search engine; it helps you construct the search query, but then it's over to WordPress to run the actual search.

= About =

Facetious is a product of [Code For The People Ltd](http://codeforthepeople.com), and is based on work done during 2012 on behalf of several UK public sector clients, among them:

 * The [Commission on Devolution in Wales](http://commissionondevolutioninwales.independent.gov.uk)
 * The [National Audit Office](http://www.nao.org.uk); and
 * The Department for Culture, Media and Sport through its [Government Olympic Communication](http://goc2012.culture.gov.uk) site

... which is why we're keen to offer it for wider public use.

= Usage =

The simplest way to add a Facetious search form is to add the Facetious widget to your sidebar. You'll see a complete list of options so you can choose which fields to include in your search form.

= Advanced Usage =

Developers can use a template function to output a Facetious search form and have complete control over the form and its fields, such as text labels, class names, etc.

The main template function for outputting a Facetious search form is `facetious( $args )`. If you want to ensure the site doesn't break if the Facetious plugin is deactivated, you can use `do_action( 'facetious', $args );` instead.

'$args' is an array of arguments thus:

 * `submit` - string  - The text for the submit button.
 * `echo`   - boolean - Whether to echo the form out or not.
 * `class`  - string  - The class name for the form.
 * `id`     - string  - The ID attribute for the form.
 * `fields` - array   - A list of fields to show in the form. See below.

Each item in the 'fields' array can be either:

 * A string name of a taxonomy
 * An array of details for the field (see below)
 * One of `s`, `m` or `pt` for the keyword search input, month dropdown and post type dropdown respectively

For each field specified as an array you can specify:
 
 * `label`   - string - The descriptive text for this field. Defaults to the name of the taxonomy, or 'All types' for post types..
 * `class`   - string - The class name for the field.
 * `id`      - string - The ID attribute for the field.
 * `all`     - string - The "All items" text for this field. Defaults to the 'all_items' label of the taxonomy.
 * `options` - array  - For a taxonomy provide an array with the term slug as the key and the term name as the value, e.g. `array( 'term-1' => 'Term 1', 'term-2' => 'Term 2' );`, for post type supply an array of post type names.

Example 1:

`do_action( 'facetious', array(
	'submit' => 'Search',
	'fields' => array(
		's',
		'category',
		'custom_tax_1',
		'custom_tax_2'
	)
) );`

Example 2:

`do_action( 'facetious', array(
	'submit' => 'Search',
	'fields' => array(
		's',
		'custom_tax_1' => array(
			'label' => 'Select an option',
			'class' => 'my_tax_class',
			'id'    => 'my_tax_id',
			'all'   => 'All terms'
		)
		'custom_tax_2',
		'm'
	)
) );`
