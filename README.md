Rescue Case Management
===

Provide a way for volunteers to create and update rescue cases.


## To get started
1. There's an sql dump in the root. Use it. 
1. There's a wp-config-sample file. Use it. Make sure you read the comments.
1. Once you get everything set up the __first__ thing you need to do is login via /wp-login.php __then__ go comment out the line in wp-config.php that's sets RELOCATE to true.
1. Username/password for this sql dump is master/changeme. Don't worry. It's changed on the live site.
1. Live site is on http://sagip.me/
